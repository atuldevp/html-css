			<p>
				It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females and have a prominent mane. 
				It is a social species, forming groups called prides. A lion's pride consists of a few adult males, related females, and cubs. 
				Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on large ungulates. 
				The lion is an apex and keystone predator; although some lions scavenge when opportunities occur and have been known to hunt humans, the species typically does not actively seek out and prey on humans.
				The lion inhabits grasslands, savannas and shrublands. It is usually more diurnal than other wild cats, but when persecuted, it adapts to being active at night and at twilight. </p>
